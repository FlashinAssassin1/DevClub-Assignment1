      <p id="faqs1">FAQs</p>
      <p id="what">What is Omicron?</p>
      <p id="para1">The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is a variant of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) that was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from South Africa on 24 November 2021.[5][6]

        Omicron multiplies around 70 times faster than the Delta variant in the bronchi (lung airways) but evidence suggests it is less severe than previous strains, especially compared to the Delta variant.</p>
      <p id="should">Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?</p>
      <p id="para2">Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 30 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</p>
      <p id="complications">Is the Omicron variant of COVID-19 less severe?</p>
      <p id="para3">No, it is not. Omicron may cause less severe disease in most individuals, but because of its very high transmissibility, hospitals may get flooded with those who remain unimmunised, those living with comorbidities, or those with supressed immune systems.</p>
